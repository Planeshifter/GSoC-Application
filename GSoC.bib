abstract = {This paper expands the specification of a set of$\backslash$nkernel routines for linear algebra, historically$\backslash$ncalled the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and$\backslash$ncommonly known as the BLAS.$\backslash$par Numerical linear$\backslash$nalgebra, particularly the solution of linear systems$\backslash$nof equations, linear least squares problems,$\backslash$neigenvalue problems and singular value problems, is$\backslash$nfundamental to most calculations in scientific$\backslash$ncomputing, and is often the computationally intense$\backslash$npart of such calculations. Designers of computer$\backslash$nprograms involving linear algebraic operations have$\backslash$nfrequently chosen to implement certain low level$\backslash$noperations, such as the dot product or the matrix$\backslash$nvector product, as separate subprograms. This may be$\backslash$nobserved both in many published codes and in codes$\backslash$nwritten for specific applications at many computer$\backslash$ninstallations.$\backslash$par A major aim of the standards$\backslash$ndefined in this paper is to enable linear algebra$\backslash$nlibraries (both public domain and commercial) to$\backslash$ninteroperate efficiently, reliably and easily.},

@article{Angerson1990,
abstract = {The goal of the LAPACK project is to design and implement a
portable linear algebra library for efficient use on a variety of
high-performance computers. The library is based on the widely used
LINPACK and EISPACK packages for solving linear equations, eigenvalue
problems, and linear least-squares problems, but extends their
functionality in a number of ways. The major methodology for making the
algorithms run faster is to restructure them to perform block matrix
operations (e.g., matrix-matrix multiplication) in their inner loops.
These block operations may be optimized to exploit the memory hierarchy
of a specific architecture. The LAPACK project is also working on new
algorithms that yield higher relative accuracy for a variety of linear
algebra problems},
